The Guardian published a set of [programming tests](https://github.com/guardian/pairing-tests) it uses in their engineer recruiting. I thought they were quite intriguing, so I gave them a go. I did not lookup any patterns or pre-existing solutions to these problems, I'm just attacking it as I know best.

Just so you know, I don't have a compsci background, so the algorithms probably won't be ideal in places. Also, it's not always clear what the constraints are - ie, what the cpu/disk/ram/network situation is, if we're doing cold or warm starts etc. But hey, I'm just playing around.

All the problem sets inherit the license from the original repo. My code carries no license, you're free to do whatever you want with it.
